promote the resident's ability to adapt and adjust to living as
independently and safely as possible. This concept actively focuses on
achieving and maintaining optimal physical, mental, an d psychosocial
functioning. Generally, RNPs are initiated when a resident is discharged
from formalized physical, occupational or speech rehabilitation therapy.
A resident may also be started on an RNP when she/he is admitted to the
facility with restorative needs but is not a candidate for formalized
rehabilitation therapy or when a restorative need arises during a
custodial stay."\
The RNP is designed to promote/improve strength, endurance, balance, and
mobility.

individuals and to train them for a successful career in the healthcare

available and less qualified healthcare professionals. It is our goal to
strive to meet the medical needs of our socially diverse community by
instructing and developing qualified professionals with multilingual
skills and/or multiethnic understanding.\
It is our intent to successfully train and prepare students by adhering
to the philosophy of a "patient -centered approach." Students completing
the programs will be able to confidently demonstrate and practice
requisite skills and knowledge.\

Program, and Nurse Assistant Program have been developed to prepare the
student for certification by the State of California as an entry -level
worker on a health care team in a long-term care facility and at homes.

on skills needed to function as a NA, HHA, RNA, and MA.\

the needs of learners and society at large by: - providing learning
experiences that respond to learner interests.\

Title 22 Guidelines for safe and quality care in long-term care
settings.\
• Promote consistency in training that responds to practice as reflected
in the State Certification Exam.\

occupations.\

quality of patient care; to provide skills that was learned in NA
training and additional skills learned in HHA training for employment as

Scribd is an additional Digital Library that Lotus Medical Career
College subscribes to for its students. Scribd has an ever-expanding
library that includes over a million full -length titles, case studies
and publications in Nursing.\
Open Online Library is another option for the students:\
At its heart, Open Library is a catalog. Some of the biggest libraries
in the world ever since. They have well over 20 million editions

records online, provide access to 1.7 million scanned versions of books,
and link to external sources like WorldCat and Amazo n when we can. They
have actual document students are looking for as they can, whether that
is a scanned version courtesy of the In ternet Archive, or a link to
Powell's where you can purchase your own copy.\
Gutenberg is a place to download and read thousands of free eBooks. Open
Library's goal is to list every book -- whether in-print or out-
of-print, available at a bookstore or a library, scanned or typed in as
text. In other words, they provide access to all of Project Gutenberg's
books, but they have hundreds of thousands of others as well .

require an entrance exam measuring English competency or High School
Diploma or a GED. Each program varies in its enrollment requirements
which may be seen in each program's individual description. Students

Senate Bill No. 607 (Min, Chapter 367, Statutes of 2021)\
SB 607 makes several changes to the Department of Consumer Affairs
entity es. Pertaining to the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education,
SB 607 repealed Education Code section 94904, which required students
without a high school diploma or equivalent.\
to successfully complete an examination prior to executing an enrollment
catalog and amended section 94909 to eliminate the need to include
specific admissions requirements for these students in school catalogs

students.\
Pertinent Laws Newly Effective January 1, 2022\
Change:\
Permits students without a high school diploma or the equivalent to
enroll in private postsecondary institutions without having to complete
the admissions prerequisite of passing an alternate entrance
examination.\
Implementation:\
The Bureau will continue to: 1) monitor the existence of written
standards for each educational program during licensure and 2) ensure
enrolled students meet those standards through routine review of student
files during compliance inspections. Effective Janua ry 1, 2022, the
Bureau will no longer require a universal standard of having a high

References to ATB exams will be eliminated from Bureau regulations in
the near future.\

attendance. Please look below the enrollment agreement for further
information on refund policy.

Refund Policy\
The student has a right to a full refund of all charges less the amount
of the registration fee STRF Fee. If he/she cancels this agreement prior

scheduled to attend prior to withdrawal.\
Procedure for Refund\
If the student only completed 15 hours of a 162-hour course and paid

scheduled to attend prior to withdrawal.\
Procedure for Refund\
If the student only completed 10 hours of a 16-hour course and paid

ATTENDANCE POLICY\
Attendance is the single most critical factor for a student's success
both in school and in the workplace. Lotus Medical Career College
attendance policy is designed to ensure that students maintain
satisfactory academic progress in all of the courses required in their
program of study. Students are expected to attend all classes, be ontime
to classes, remain in class for the entire duration of the class, and be
an active participant in their classes.

Student Attendance\
Student attendance will be taken at the beginning and end of each class
and clinical training session. Excess absence can lead to a lower grade
or failure. A student who misses any time is held responsible for all
material presented during the absence. A student who is late by more
than 5 minutes is considered tardy. Three incidents of tardiness will be
considered as one absence.\
Students are expected to schedule any appointments or family obligations
in a way that does not conflict with scheduled class times. In case of
an unavoidable emergency, the student must notify both their Instructor
and the Registrar in advance of the situation. Additionally,

LOTUS MEDICAL CAREER COLLEGE\
P a g e 45 \| 68\
PB-AJ 5/18/2022 APPD. by BPPE 6/1/2021; 10/03/2023 , 1/23/2025 Students
must notify both a designated school staff member and the Program
Director when they will be absent or late to class or clinical. Students
in all programs must attend 100% of the program hours to have
satisfactory academic progress to graduate.\
Students are responsible for tracking their own attendance and making
any necessary arrangements with the school in case of emergencies. The
maximum number of two consecutive excused absences that will result in
students being automatically withdrawn from the program is (2) calendar
days (3 tardiness is considered as one absence). Students will be
terminated if they have more than one unexcused absence. Excused or
unexcused absences must be made up immediately as per CDPH guidelines.\
Whether the student has an excused or unexcused absence, students will
be terminated from the program if they do not attend t he prescribed
modules required by the California Department of Public Health prior to
starting their clinical.\
Procedure Attendance Records and Absences\
Attendance will be documented daily and recorded by the instructor;
student absences will be documented from the date of the first meeting
of the class day. Lotus Medical Career College will continue to monitor
the student's attendance in accordance with the following procedure:\
1. The faculty members shall report each absence by submitting the daily
class roster to the Office Manager and Director of Nursing. If faculty
member is at the clinical, must call Office Manager Or the program
director to report the absence for morning class by 7:30 AM and for the
evening class by 3:30 PM.\
2. Once a student has missed one class, the faculty member shall
immediately contact the student (via e-mail or phone) to remind him/her
of the institution's attendance policy and the faculty member will
submit the requisite reports to the office manager . 3. A student who
has not met the attendance requirement by the midpoint of his/her
program will be placed on probation (see probation form).\
For those on probation, a committee will determine the status of the
academic progress of the student. The Committee (Program Director,
Instructor, and two other available administrative staff members)
meeting is to establish the student's interest in continuing in the
program, what work is to be made up, and whether the student should
continue to be placed on academic probation. One of the following
actions may be taken:\
1. The Committee may determine that the student is maintaining Academic
progress and may continue class on academic probation status either
until the end of the module/course OR the payment period.\
2. The Committee may determine that the student cannot maintain Academic
progress and the student will be withdrawn\
from the course.

Make -up work may be required for any absence at the discretion of the

instruction or assignments to the students including but not limited to
providing instruction on how to approach an assignmen t, what material
was missed in class, an actual examination that the student missed due

attend classes on a regular and consistent basis. Additionally, make up
work done at home cannot be used to count towards hours needed to
complete the program. Theory hours must be made up prior to starting the
next clinical day.

Students absent for more than 12 clock hours in a (module) course will
automatically fail that module/course and will be required to repeat the
module or course in its entirety. Students are responsible for keeping
track of their time. Students may request a copy of their attendance at
the front desk during business hours. Make up hours' availability is
restricted to the designated make up day for that module and class
session. If students want to receive hours for attending on make -up
day, students must obtain make up form from Office Manager. The Office
Manager will accept the form once it is completed by Instructor. If a
student has not achieved 100% attendance by the close of the module, the
student will fail the module and must repeat it. Students cannot make up
tests or assignments for that module after themake -up day.

Make -up Work Assignments\
Students are required to make up all assignments and work missed because
of absences. Arrangements to take tests and/or quizzes missed because of
an absence or tardy can only be made with the instructor's approval. The
maximum score allowed on a makeup examination\
is only the passing grade, but student needs to score the remediation
score according to each program . Pop- quizzes are not eligible for make
-up. Make -Up Classes\
Any missed classes must be made up and paid for by the student (\$50.00)
to progress to the next clinicalday (6 hours - maximum missed hours)
/earn graduate status (See attendance policy).

is among the reasons for dismissal. Any tardiness that will lead to
probation of student and non-compliance will be documented by the
instructor and kept in student file. No credit for time missed is
givento students who depart scheduled classes early or come to scheduled
classes late.\
Excused Absence Policy and Procedure\
For all clock -hour programs, up to 10% of the scheduled clock hours may
