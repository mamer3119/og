# HHA Program FAQ

## Program Overview

### What is a Home Health Aide?
A Home Health Aide is a trained healthcare professional who provides essential support with daily living tasks, medical care, and companionship to clients in their homes. HHAs work one-on-one with elderly individuals, patients with disabilities, those with chronic illnesses, and hospice clients, helping them maintain independence and quality of life in familiar surroundings.

### How is HHA work different from CNA work in facilities?
While CNAs typically work in hospitals or nursing homes with multiple patients, HHAs provide personalized, one-on-one care in clients' homes. HHAs develop deeper relationships with clients, manage home environments, prepare meals, and often become trusted companions. The work offers more autonomy, regular schedules with consistent clients, and the satisfaction of helping people remain in their homes.

### What will I learn in the 40-hour program?
Our comprehensive curriculum covers everything needed for home healthcare success:

- Week 1 (20 hours theory): Medical and social needs assessment, personal care techniques, nutrition and meal preparation, home safety and cleaning
- Weeks 2-3 (20 hours clinical): Hands-on practice with real clients, equipment mastery, emergency procedures, documentation skills

### Why does LMCC require state certification when some programs don't?
State certification through the CNA/HHA Competency Evaluation ensures you meet California's highest standards for home healthcare. This certification makes you more competitive for employment, qualifies you for higher-paying positions, and demonstrates your professional commitment. We believe in preparing you for the best opportunities, which is why we pay your $120 exam fee.

## Eligibility & Prerequisites

### Do I need active CNA certification to enroll?
Yes, you must have an active, unrestricted CNA certification to begin our HHA program. This ensures you have the foundational healthcare knowledge needed for advanced home health training. Your CNA must remain active throughout the program.

### Can I start if I just finished CNA training but haven't taken the state exam?
No, unlike some programs, LMCC requires active CNA certification before HHA enrollment. This ensures you're fully prepared for the advanced concepts and can legally participate in clinical rotations. We recommend scheduling your HHA training after passing your CNA exam.

### What if my CNA certification is from another state?
You'll need to transfer your CNA certification to California or obtain California certification before enrolling. Our admissions team can guide you through the transfer process. Contact us at (909) 625-8050 for assistance.
