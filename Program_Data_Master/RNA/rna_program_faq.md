# RNA Program FAQ

## Program Overview

### What is a Restorative Nurse Assistant?
A Restorative Nurse Assistant (RNA) is a specialized healthcare professional who helps patients regain and maintain their maximum functional abilities. RNAs work as vital team members in rehabilitation settings, implementing restorative care techniques, assisting with mobility exercises, and supporting patients' independence in daily activities.

### How does RNA work differ from regular CNA duties?
While CNAs provide essential daily care, RNAs focus specifically on rehabilitation and maintaining patient function. RNAs implement specialized techniques like range of motion exercises, use adaptive equipment, lead restorative feeding programs, and work closely with physical therapy teams to prevent patient decline and promote independence.

### What will I learn in the 50-hour program?
Our comprehensive curriculum covers 9 modules including restorative nursing principles, anatomy and physiology for restorative care, range of motion procedures, ambulation techniques, activities of daily living support, restorative feeding, dementia care, and therapeutic communication. You'll gain both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

### Why is there no clinical component required?
The RNA certification builds upon your existing CNA clinical experience. The 50 hours of focused theory provides the specialized knowledge needed for restorative care, while your current CNA practice already provides the hands-on patient care foundation. You'll practice techniques in our fully-equipped skills lab.

## Eligibility & Prerequisites

### Do I need to be a CNA first?
Yes, active CNA certification is required before enrolling in the RNA program. This advanced training builds upon your foundational CNA skills and knowledge.

### How current must my CNA certification be?
Your CNA certification must be active and in good standing at the time of enrollment and throughout the RNA program. Expired certifications must be renewed before starting.

### Can I enroll if my CNA is from another state?
Yes, as long as your out-of-state CNA certification is recognized in California or you're in the process of transferring it. Contact us at (909) 625-8050 to discuss your specific situation.

### What if my CNA certification expires during the program?
You must maintain active CNA certification throughout the entire RNA program. If your certification is approaching expiration, we recommend renewing it before enrollment.
