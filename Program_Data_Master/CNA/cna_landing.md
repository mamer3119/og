### What is a CNA?
A Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) helps patients with activities of daily living and other healthcare needs under the direct supervision of a Registered Nurse (RN) or Licensed Vocational Nurse (LVN). CNAs are also commonly referred to as Nursing Assistants, Patient Care Assistants (PCAs), or Nurse's Aides.

Many individuals use their CNA knowledge to bridge into careers as LVNs or RNs. A significant number of CNAs are already in nursing school programs and use this career to gain real-world healthcare experience. Others become CNAs to determine if healthcare is the right career path for them.
