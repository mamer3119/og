## ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
### Statement of Philosophy
**Nurse Assistant**  
The intent of NA (Nurse Assistant) curriculum is to promote quality of patient care; to provide entry-level skills for employment as a NA, and to provide awareness of opportunities/choices in health care occupations.

### Conceptual Framework
The conceptual framework of the curriculum is based on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. The Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs focuses on physiology, safety, protection, love, belonging, self-esteem, and self-actualization.  
The additional organizing principles of caring, critical thinking/problem solving, team building, ethics, and cultural sensitivity have been integrated in with selected curriculum activities.  
• **Caring**  
The demonstration of empathy and concern for the client's comfort and well-being. Respecting the client's lifestyle, personal beliefs, environment, and personal property. Recognizing the importance of the client's family, caregivers, and other relationships.  
• **Critical Thinking/Problem Solving**  
When given a problem or situation, the identification and collection of relevant information and collaboration with others to address the situation.  
• **Team building**  
Interacting effectively with members of the health care team, family, or others involved in the care of the client. Demonstrating accountability and loyalty to the team.  
• **Ethics**  
The demonstrations of honesty, confidentiality, and integrity. Recognizing the need for separation of the Certified Nurse Assistant role from one's personal life.  
• **Cultural Sensitivity**  
The awareness of and respect for various cultural, ethnic, and religious beliefs and practices.

## OWNERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE
Lotus Medical Career College, owned by Asima Jabbar, is incorporated in the state of California as a for-profit corporation, duly formed and organized under the laws and regulations of the Secretary of State for the State of California. The Articles of Incorporation were filed with the Secretary of State.

## HISTORY
The Lotus Medical Career College (LMCC) was founded in 2015 by Asima Jabbar who recognized the demand for qualified healthcare professionals in a community where the patients are diverse and proficient care is at a deficit. LMCC is a private education institution in the city of Pomona. Lotus Medical Career College will provide a comprehensive education in the field of healthcare by offering courses that will culminate into careers in the nursing health care profession.

## MISSION STATEMENT AND OBJECTIVE
Reflecting our diverse and vast community, it is our mission to train, educate, and prepare multiethnic healthcare professionals. It is our objective to leverage the cultural and multilingual knowledge of individuals and to train them for a successful career in the healthcare field.  
Due to the large size of the community, there is a shortage of patient-to-healthcare professional ratio as well as the number of "beds" available and less qualified healthcare professionals. It is our goal to strive to meet the medical needs of our socially diverse community by instructing and developing qualified professionals with multilingual skills and/or multiethnic understanding.  
It is our intent to successfully train and prepare students by adhering to the philosophy of a "patient-centered approach." Students completing the programs will be able to confidently demonstrate and practice requisite skills and knowledge.

## GOAL AND OBJECTIVES
The Nurse Assistant Program has been developed to prepare the student for certification by the State of California as an entry-level worker on a health care team in a long-term care facility. The curriculum is structured to provide theory and practical application on skills needed to function as a NA.  
To achieve the stated goal, the curriculum is designed to:  
• Focus on the needs of learners and society at large by:  
  - providing learning experiences that respond to learner interests.  
  - promoting clarity and understanding of the larger world.  
  - fostering development of citizenship and economic survival skills.  
  - developing learners' feelings of self-understanding and personal worth.  
• Implement an NA curriculum that meets OBRA and California Title 22 Guidelines for safe and quality care in long-term care settings.  
• Promote consistency in training that responds to practice as reflected in the State Certification Exam.  
• Promote consistency and equity between different teaching environments.  
• The intent of NA (Nurse Assistant) curriculum is to promote quality of patient care; to provide entry-level skills for employment as a NA, and to provide awareness of opportunities/choices in health care occupations.  

Lotus Medical Career College, via the Program Director, will regularly monitor and evaluate each program and course to ensure that all teaching methods as well as classroom and clinical environment adhere to the above stated Goals and Objectives.

## STUDENT TUITION RECOVERY FUND (STRF)
### Student Tuition Recovery Fund (STRF) Disclosure
a) A qualifying institution shall include the following statement on both its enrollment agreement and school catalog:  
"The State of California established the Student Tuition Recovery Fund (STRF) to relieve or mitigate economic loss suffered by a student in an educational program at a qualifying institution, who is or was a California resident while enrolled, or was enrolled in a residency program, if the student enrolled in the institution, prepaid tuition, and suffered an economic loss. Unless relieved of the obligation to do so, you must pay the state-imposed assessment for the STRF, or it must be paid on your behalf, if you are a student in an educational program, who is a California resident, or are enrolled in a residency program, and prepay all or part of your tuition.  
You are not eligible for protection from the STRF, and you are not required to pay the STRF assessment, if you are not a California resident, or are not enrolled in a residency program."  
b) In addition to the statement required under subdivision (a) of this section, a qualifying institution shall include the following statement in its school catalog:  
"It is important that you keep copies of your enrollment agreement, financial aid documents, receipts, or any other information that documents the amount paid to the school. Questions regarding the STRF may be directed to the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, 1747 N. Market Blvd. Ste 225 Sacramento, CA 95834, (916) 574-8900 or (888) 370-7589."

To be eligible for STRF, you must be a California resident or are enrolled in a residency program, prepaid tuition, paid or deemed to have paid the STRF assessment, and suffered an economic loss because of any of the following:  
1. The institution, a location of the institution, or an educational program offered by the institution was closed or discontinued, and you did not choose to participate in a teach-out plan approved by the Bureau or did not complete a chosen teach-out plan approved by the Bureau.  
2. You were enrolled at an institution or a location of the institution within the 120-day period before the closure of the institution or location of the institution or were enrolled in an educational program within the 120-day period before the program was discontinued.  
3. You were enrolled at an institution or a location of the institution more than 120 days before the closure of the institution or location of the institution, in an educational program offered by the institution as to which the Bureau determined there was a significant decline in the quality or value of the program more than 120 days before closure.  
4. The institution has been ordered to pay a refund by the Bureau but has failed to do so.  
5. The institution has failed to pay or reimburse loan proceeds under a federal student loan program as required by law or has failed to pay or reimburse proceeds received by the institution in excess of tuition and other costs.  
6. You have been awarded restitution, a refund, or other monetary award by an arbitrator or court, based on a violation of this chapter by an institution or representative of an institution, but have been unable to collect the award from the institution.  
7. You sought legal counsel that resulted in the cancellation of one or more of your student loans and have an invoice for services rendered and evidence of the cancellation of the student loan or loans.  
To qualify for STRF reimbursement, the application must be received within four (4) years from the date of the action or event that made the student eligible for recovery from STRF.  
A student whose loan is revived by a loan holder or debt collector after a period of noncollecting may, at any time, file a written application for recovery from STRF for the debt that would have otherwise been eligible for recovery. If it has been more than four (4) years since the action or event that made the student eligible, the student must have filed a written application for recovery within the original four (4) year period, unless the period has been extended by another act of law.  
However, no claim can be paid to any student without a social security number or a taxpayer identification number."  
Note: Authority cited: Sections 94803, 94877, and 94923, Education Code. Reference: Section 94923, 94924, and 94925, Education Code.

## LIBRARIES AND OTHER LEARNING RESOURCES
LMCC has an on-campus library measuring 12 x 15 feet that is available for students. Students utilize this space either to learn and study and/or help prepare for the State Exam. We have 2 tables, 1 Bookshelf, and 10 chairs for student use. We have a library of books, journals, workbooks, and periodicals that are less than 10 years old. We have computer and internet access, and clinical supplies that the students can use to study, practice, and learn. The library is accessible during normal school hours from Monday through Friday between 9:00AM -- 5:00PM and/or by scheduled appointment. We make these tools accessible in the house only for independent study and for classroom use.  
Students will also have access to materials such as PowerPoints, eBooks, as well as handouts through their CANVAS which will be available for every program. Students will be given their own personal access to their own personal CANVAS accounts.  
**OPTIONAL:**  
LMCC students may also have additional access to online library and learning resources.

Scribd is an additional Digital Library that Lotus Medical Career College subscribes to for its students. Scribd has an ever-expanding library that includes over a million full-length titles, case studies, and publications in Nursing.  
Open Online Library is another option for the students:  
At its heart, Open Library is a catalog. Some of the biggest libraries in the world ever since. They have well over 20 million editions records online, provide access to 1.7 million scanned versions of books, and link to external sources like WorldCat and Amazon when we can. They have actual document students are looking for as they can, whether that is a scanned version courtesy of the Internet Archive, or a link to Powell's where you can purchase your own copy.  
Gutenberg is a place to download and read thousands of free eBooks. Open Library's goal is to list every book -- whether in-print or out-of-print, available at a bookstore or a library, scanned or typed in as text. In other words, they provide access to all of Project Gutenberg's books, but they have hundreds of thousands of others as well.
